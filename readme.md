# LGBM classifier
LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It's designed to be efficient, fast, and high-performance. LGBM is particularly well-suited for large datasets and complex machine learning tasks.\

* Histogram-based algorithm: LGBM uses histograms to approximate the distribution of data, significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.
* Exclusive feature bundling: This technique merges features with similar values, further improving computational efficiency.
* Categorical feature support: LGBM can directly handle categorical features without requiring one-hot encoding.
* Gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS): GOSS focuses on data points with high gradients, improving training speed and generalization performance.
* Exclusive feature importance: This feature provides insights into the importance of each feature in the model.
